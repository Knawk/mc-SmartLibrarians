**SmartLibrarians** is a Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.17 that gives players some control over the enchantment RNG for librarian villagers' enchanted book trades.
If an enchantable item is placed in an item frame above a librarian's lectern, and the librarian acquires a new enchanted book trade, then the book's enchantment will be guaranteed to be applicable to the item's type.
Like vanilla Minecraft, all applicable enchantment types are equally likely, and all levels of the enchantment are equally likely.
